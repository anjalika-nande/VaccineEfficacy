    "# Model - Waning\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we build off the modified SEIR model to include the possible waning effect of vaccination. Protection provided by vaccination is known to decrease over time, causing the vaccinated population to become once again susceptible to the disease. Thus, it is important to explore the effect of waning on the population dynamics between the two vaccine failure modes. Similar to the other models, all variables were normalized such that $N = S + V_{S} + V_{R} + E + I + R = 1$ and vaccines were administered instantaneously.\n",
